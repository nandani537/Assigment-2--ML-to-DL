# Assignment-2(ML to DL)
# Federated Learning Project

This repository contains an implementation of Federated Learning (FL) to simulate collaborative learning across multiple nodes (stations). The project includes analysis of node connectivity, local averaging, and error estimation in FL networks.

## Project Overview

Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple devices or nodes to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping data local. This project explores:
- Construction of FL network graphs based on geographical and statistical distances.
- Analyzing network connectivity using node degrees and Laplacian eigenvectors.
- Simulating local averaging and prediction error estimation.

## Files and Structure

- `notebooks/Federated_Learning.ipynb`: The main Colab notebook with the full implementation.
- `data/`: Placeholder for data files (or links to external datasets).
- `images/`: Visualizations generated by the notebook.
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries required for this project.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/nandani537/Federated_Learning.ipynb

cd Assignment-2-ML-to-DL

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Install required libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If there's no requirements.txt, manually install NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.)

### 3. Run the Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open Federated_Learning.ipynb:
jupyter notebook

## Usage

Open the Federated_Learning.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
Follow the step-by-step implementation to understand and run the Federated Learning model.
Modify parameters to experiment with different configurations.
